= GosuTaxi

This project is thought of as a test for the gosu game dev library. It's 
current primary goal is to mimick the C64 game "Space Taxi".

It will use gosu and most probably Chipmunk, the physics library. Please have
a look at the following URLs to learn how to install those two libs on your 
platform.

Please don't ask me for a binary version just yet. That'd be silly. I mean, 
look at the state of the in game gfx.  :)

= Todo

* making the tiles 16x16 to allow for bigger maps
* almost everything. physics, collision detection, people, driving
* cool additions on top of the original gameplay (networking?)
